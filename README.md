# Space Adventure

A simple exploration of the solar system (or, really, an exploration of the Dart language).

## Example Text Input/Output (The "Spec")

```
Welcome to the Solar System!
There are 8 planets to explore.
What is your name?
Jane
Nice to meet you, Jane. My name is Eliza, I'm an old friend of Siri.
Let's go on an adventure!
Shall I randomly choose a planet for you to visit? (Y or N)
N
Name the planet you would like to visit.
Neptune
Traveling to Neptune...
Arrived at Neptune. A very cold planet, furthest from the sun.
```

## Ideas

1. Main loop to repeat or quit.
2. Error checking (eg name).
3. Command-line arguments for JSON data file.
